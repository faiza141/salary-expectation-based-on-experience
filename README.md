#Project Overview:

In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict salary expectations based on years of professional experience. Using a simple linear regression approach, the model was trained on a dataset containing salary and experience data points.

#Key Features:

Model: Simple Linear Regression

Performance: Achieved an RÂ² score of 89%, indicating a strong correlation between experience and salary.

Tools: Python, scikit-learn, pandas

#Highlights:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Model training and evaluation

Visualizations of regression results and residual analysis

Model deployment-ready notebook for easy reproducibility
